jobSchema.set("toJSON", {
  virtuals: true,
  transform: (doc, ret) => {
    ret.id = ret._id;
    return ret;
  },
});
Question: What does this code accomplish? Why is it useful in your application?

--> Its create the  new virtual id filed in our database. it is mostly to be used to pass the data to front-end or to another tbale throug the id rather then using _id which might create a confussion or problem also it is safe.

app.use(cors());
Question: What is CORS, and why is it necessary for the application to include this middleware?

--> Its a a node package that helps to get access to cross resources
its full from is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing 

proxy: {
  "/api": {
    target: "http://localhost:4000",
    changeOrigin: true,
  },
}
Question: How does this proxy setting work, and what problems does it solve in the development environment?

--> This proxy acts same way as the axios work, what it does is it say which url that You need to hit rather the hitting same url of the frontend. The main purpose of this is to connect the backend to the frontend, make the application fullStack and access the dynamic data rather then relay on the static one.
